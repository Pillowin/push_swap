# push_swap

## Summary
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## Todo

- Implement small garbage collector
- Implement operations
- Implement data structure functions
- Parse arguments

- Norm all
- Test leaks

- Explicit files in Makefile
- Remove unneeded flags in Makefile
