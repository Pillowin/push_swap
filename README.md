# push_swap

## Summary
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## Fixes

- Handle errors in `sa` `sb` and `ss`

## Todo

- ~~Implement small garbage collector~~
- ~~Implement data structure functions~~
- ~~Implement operations~~
- ~~Handle error cases~~
- ~~Parse arguments~~
- ~~Implement output list~~
- ~~Sort manualy for very small lists~~
- ~~Refactor output list of 5 numbers list~~
- ~~Merge list function~~
- ~~Refactor output list~~
- ~~Change set to only positive numbers with interval of 1~~
- ~~Quick sort~~

- ~~Find pivot intervall in order to know if we need to apply insertion or create new pivots~~

- Create new pivot for big chunks
	- ~~update pivots functions~~
	- ~~copy func to create pivots out of quick_sort.c~~
	- ~~restart same algo to create pivots~~
	=> ~~need to create struct for gc a b out ? in order to pass args~~
	- ~~intervall / 2~~
	- ~~find magic values~~

- ~~Creation de pivot~~
	- ~~push pivot at end of B~~
	- ~~push smaller in B~~
	- ~~push bigger at end of A~~

	- ~~push end of A at the begining of A~~
	- ~~push pivot (end of B) at begining of A~~

	- ~~new pivot in B~~
	- ~~push bigger in A~~
	- ~~push smaller at end of B~~
	- ~~push pivot at end of A~~

	- ~~push pivot at begining of A~~
	- ~~push smaller (in B) at begining of A => or Insertion sort~~

- ~~Insertion sort~~
	- ~~check if value is in A or B~~
		- ~~A~~
		- ~~while not interesting_value PB~~
		- ~~RA~~

		- ~~B~~
		- ~~find optimal RB or RRB~~
		- ~~PA~~
		- ~~RA~~

- Fix pivot calculation while creating new ones in A and B
- Fix find_intervall

- Play with magic number
- Norm all
- Test leaks

- Explicit files in Makefile
- Remove unneeded flags in Makefile
