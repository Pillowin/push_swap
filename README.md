# push_swap

## Summary
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## Fixes

- Handle errors in `sa` `sb` and `ss`

## Todo

- ~~Implement small garbage collector~~
- ~~Implement data structure functions~~
- ~~Implement operations~~
- ~~Handle error cases~~
- ~~Parse arguments~~
- ~~Implement output list~~
- ~~Sort manualy for very small lists~~
- ~~Refactor output list of 5 numbers list~~
- ~~Merge list function~~
- ~~Refactor output list~~
- Change set to only positive numbers with interval of 1
- Insertion sort for small lists
- Insertion sort for big lists

- Norm all
- Test leaks

- Explicit files in Makefile
- Remove unneeded flags in Makefile
